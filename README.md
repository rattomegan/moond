# Moond Period Tracker

This is a basic period tracking calendar. You have the option to track cycle phases and keep notes for each day. The goal was to create a simple and straightforward application that is clean to look at and easy to use.

## Getting Started

See app [here](https://moond.herokuapp.com/).

Link to [Trello planning board](https://trello.com/b/i9mPrcy4/moond).

Log in with your google account to access app. Click on any calendar day to add a phase to that day. Edit notes within phase/date detail.

## Next Steps

- Udpate user interface to make app more polished. 
- Update cycle options, with more detailed notes. I would also like to add the notes form to the add phase modal.
- I would like to incorporate the phases of the moon so that they can be tracked alongside of your cycle. Each day would include information about that specific moon.
- Users can add friends that can view their cycles and notes.
- Eventually I would like to add in herbal remedies and suggestions for each phase of a cycle.
- Integrate/link Google calendar.
